# Sentiment Analysis

> This repository contains Flask and FastAPI applications that allows one to enter text data. Then, the program determines whether the text is positive or negative.

The model used was trained on a [dataset from Twitter available at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

If you are interested on how the model was trained, you can check out my article in Medium [https://medium.com/@richardodhiambo/getting-started-with-sentiment-analysis-9713509b8db1](https://medium.com/@richardodhiambo/getting-started-with-sentiment-analysis-9713509b8db1). I hope you found this article informative and helpful. If you have any feedback or suggestions on how I can improve my approach or the model, please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section. I would love to hear your feedback and engage with you on this topic!
